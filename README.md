#libpastebin

libpastebin contains the api for [pastebin.com](http://pastebin.com/) written in C.

Dependencies are simple for the library, since only libcurl is needed.

Installation _should_ be as simple as:
```sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev```, or whatever the curl package is for your platform.

#Compiling

The makefile is pretty braindead and only builds 3 things:
* libpastebin -- Just the file libpastebin.so, in the lib directory
* pb -- a self-contained executable that allows you to paste files to pastebin. Look at ```bin/pb --help``` for more information. This is the default for ```make all```
* pb_debug -- Same as above, with a **lot** of debugging output.
